# Octdoc

3D graphics engine (WIP)
Uses DirectX 11

Requires: 
1. OctdocMath to work (https://github.com/Octdoc/OctdocMath)
2. DirectX SDK (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)

Linking is set so, if the two solution folders are in the same folder, it should work.
DirectX SDK path should be "C://Program Files (x86)/Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)" or edited in "Code/graphics/directx11/texture_dx11.cpp"
